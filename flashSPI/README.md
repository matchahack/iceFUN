# Flash Read ID Operation

This project directory contains an implimentation of the `Resume from Deep Power-Down and Read Device ID (ABh) ` operation initiated by the FPGA device on the iceFUN, to the [flash device](https://www.digikey.com/htmldatasheets/production/1568138/0/0/1/at25sf081-shd-t.html) on the iceFUN.

# Use

It is possible to install the necessary pre-requisites for compilation and testing from two sources:

- [robot electronics webpage](https://www.robot-electronics.co.uk/icefun.html)

- [apio](https://github.com/FPGAwars/apio)

Once binary is flashed to the iceFUN, the leds will desplay the deviceID
